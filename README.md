# StackToDisco
_or StackOverflow to Discord Orleans Inquiry Relay_

## Setup

1. Get a Discord bot token on their developers page [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Put the token in `appsettings.json`
3. Find the channel id you want the messages to be posted to. Here's a [support article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) if you can't locate the channel id. Also put it in `appsettings.json`
4. Optionally: change the query interval. By default it performs the search once a week.
5. Run the app!
